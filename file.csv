This is due to the volume of air circulating through the chamber and across the heater.A high (100%) fan speed draws more ambient air into the chamber, while a low (50%) fan speed draws in less ambient air.The fan speed also impacts the volume of air (humidity) leaving the oven through the adjustable exhaust port.Adjustable exhaust port: Closing the vent will retain the humidity in the oven, causing a slower heat rise. It also reduces the number of heat exchanges by not allowing ambient air to be drawn into the oven’s chamber and over the heating element. Opening the vent will allow the humidity to dissipate, speeding up the heating process, allowing more ambient air to be drawn into the chamber, and speeding up baking. Multi-step programs: You can control how quickly you reach the desired setpoint by stepping from one temperature to another, holding for a period for the temperature to stabilize, and repeating this process until you reach the final (desired) setpoint. No matter what fan speed you utilize, how open or closed the adjustable exhaust vent is, or whether you use a fixed-value or multi-step program, you will notice two things.The oven starts heating rapidly, and as it closes in on the setpoint, the heating slows down so as not to overshoot the setpoint.The larger the difference between chamber temperature and the setpoint, the faster the rise. The smaller the differential between chamber temperature and setpoint, the longer it takes to reach the setpoint. This is especially important to understand when using multistep programs.For example, if the oven chamber is at ambient (20-25OC) and the setpoint is 200OC, the oven will ramp up faster than if, at the end of a step, the chamber temperature is at 150OC and the setpoint is 200OC. Other factors impacting the setpoint reach and baking times include the number/volume of specimens, samples, or parts, their mass, the type(s) of materials in the specimens, samples, or parts, and their density inside the chamber.

This is due to the volume of air circulating through the chamber and across the heater.A high (100%) fan speed draws more ambient air into the chamber, while a low (50%) fan speed draws in less ambient air.The fan speed also impacts the volume of air (humidity) leaving the oven through the adjustable exhaust port.Adjustable exhaust port: Closing the vent will retain the humidity in the oven, causing a slower heat rise. It also reduces the number of heat exchanges by not allowing ambient air to be drawn into the oven’s chamber and over the heating element. Opening the vent will allow the humidity to dissipate, speeding up the heating process, allowing more ambient air to be drawn into the chamber, and speeding up baking. Multi-step programs: You can control how quickly you reach the desired setpoint by stepping from one temperature to another, holding for a period for the temperature to stabilize, and repeating this process until you reach the final (desired) setpoint. No matter what fan speed you utilize, how open or closed the adjustable exhaust vent is, or whether you use a fixed-value or multi-step program, you will notice two things.The oven starts heating rapidly, and as it closes in on the setpoint, the heating slows down so as not to overshoot the setpoint.The larger the difference between chamber temperature and the setpoint, the faster the rise. The smaller the differential between chamber temperature and setpoint, the longer it takes to reach the setpoint. This is especially important to understand when using multistep programs.For example, if the oven chamber is at ambient (20-25OC) and the setpoint is 200OC, the oven will ramp up faster than if, at the end of a step, the chamber temperature is at 150OC and the setpoint is 200OC. Other factors impacting the setpoint reach and baking times include the number/volume of specimens, samples, or parts, their mass, the type(s) of materials in the specimens, samples, or parts, and their density inside the chamber. Density means they are packed close together or separated by some distance.
